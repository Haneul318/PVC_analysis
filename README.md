## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project presents a **Competitive Value Analysis (CVA)** of **Hyatt Regency Sydney**, focused on its position in the Sydney hotel market.

Key dimensions include:
- Conference/Event Facilities (30%)  
- Location (20%)  
- Staff & Service Quality (15%)  
- Breakfast (10%)  
- Loyalty Program (10%)  
- Room Amenities (10%)  
- Wi-Fi (5%)

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- **Strength:** Hyatt is Sydneyâ€™s largest conference hotel (capacity ~3,000).  
- **Weakness:** Competitors outperform Hyatt in **service quality, location, and breakfast**, creating perception gaps:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
- **Positioning:** Hyatt sits at **neutral valueâ€“price positioning**. Overpricing or underpricing beyond Â±100 AUD correlated with weaker attribute ratings:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
